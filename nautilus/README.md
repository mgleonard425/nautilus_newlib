# The Nautilus AeroKernel

Nautilus is an example of an AeroKernel, a very thin kernel-layer exposed 
(much like a library OS, or libOS) directly to the runtime and application. 
AeroKernels are suited particularly well for parallel runtimes that need fine-grained,
explicit control of the machine to squeeze every bit of performance out of it. Note that
an AeroKernel does not, by default, have a user-mode! There are several reasons for this, 
simplicity and performance among the most important. Furthermore, there are no heavy-weight
processes---only threads, all of which share an address space. Therefore, Nautilus is an 
example of a single address-space OS (SASOS). The runtime can implement user-mode features
or address space isolation if this is required for its execution model.

# Hybrid Runtimes (HRTs) and Hybrid Virtual Machines (HVM)

We call the combination of an AeroKernel and the runtime/application using it
a Hybrid Runtime, in that it is both a runtime *and* a kernel, esp. regarding its
ability to use the full machine and determine the proper abstractions to the raw hardware
(if the runtime developer sees a mismatch with his/her needs and the AeroKernel mechanisms, 
they can be overridden). 

If stronger isolation or more complete POSIX/Linux compatibility is required, it is useful
to run the HRT in the context of a Hybrid Virtual Machine. An HVM allows a virtual machine
to split the hardware resources among a regular OS (ROS) and an HRT. The HRT portion of the 
HVM can then be seen as a kind of software accelerator. Note that because of the simplicity 
of the hardware abstractions in a typical HRT, virtualization overheads are much, much less
significant than in, e.g. a Linux guest. 

# Prerequisites

- gcc cross compiler (more on this to come)
- grub version >= 2.02
- xorriso (for CD burning)
- QEMU recommended if you don't want to run on raw hardware

# Hardware Support

Nautilus works with the following hardware:

- x86_64 machines (AMD and Intel)
- Intel Xeon Phi (see http://philix.halek.co for instructions)
- as a Hybrid Virtual Machine (HVM) in the Palacios VMM (see http://v3vee.org/palacios)

# Building

First, configure Nautilus by running 

`make menuconfig`

Select any options you require, then 
run `make` to build the HRT binary image. To make a bootable CD-ROM, 
run `make isoimage`. If you see weird errors, chances are there
is something wrong with your GRUB2 toolchain (namely, `grub-mkrescue`). Make sure `grub-mkrescue`
knows where its libraries are, especially if you've installed the
latest GRUB from source. Use `grub-mkrescue -d`. We've run into issues with naming of
the GRUB2 binaries, in which case a workaround with symlinks was sufficient.


# Running and Debugging under QEMU

Recommended:

`$> qemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom nautilus.iso -m 2048`

Nautilus has multicore support, so this will also work just fine:

`$> qemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom nautilus.iso -m 2048 -smp 4`

You should see Nautilus boot up on all 4 cores.

Nautilus is a NUMA-aware AeroKernel. To see this in action, try (with a sufficiently new
version of QEMU):

```
$> qemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom nautilus.iso \
                      -m 8G \
                      -numa node,nodeid=0,cpus=0-1 \
                      -numa node,nodeid=1,cpus=2-3 \
                      -smp 4,sockets=2,cores=2,threads=1
```

Nautilus supports debugging over the serial port. This is useful if you want to
debug a physical machine remotely. All prints after the serial port has been
initialized will be redirected to COM1. To use this, find the SERIAL_REDIRECT
entry and enable it in `make menuconfig`. You can now run like this:

`$> qemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom nautilus.iso -m 2G -serial stdio`

# Running and Debugging under BOCHS

While we recommend using QEMU, sometimes it is nice to use the native debugging 
support in BOCHS. We've used BOCHS successfully with version 2.6.8. You must have
a version of BOCHS that is built with x86_64 support, which does not seem to be the
default in a lot of package repos. We had to build it manually. You probably also 
want to enable the native debugger.

Here is a BOCHS config file (`~/.bochsrc`) that we used successfully:

```
ata0-master: type=cdrom, path=nautilus.iso, status=inserted
boot: cdrom
com1: enabled=1, mode=file, dev=serial.out
cpu: count=2
cpuid: level=6, mmx=1, level=6, x86_64=1, 1g_pages=1
megs: 2048
```
