The static library libsbfileio.a, the benchmark within sysbench that tests file system performance, depends on the following functions, which are not currently defined by newlib (note: some of these appear to be internal to sysbench, and therefore are likely the result of a mistake with building sysbench rather than a limitation of newlib):

spin_lock
spin_try_lock
spin_lock_irq_save
spin_unlock
spin_unlock_irq_restore
log_text
__snprintf_chk
__stack_chk_fail
sb_rng_state
io_getevents
log_errno
sb_globals
io_submit
sb_print_value_size
sb_getpagesize
ftruncate
mmap
sb_timer_init
sb_globals
fsync
sb_get_value_int
sb_get_value_size
sb_get_value_string
sb_get_value_flag
sb_get_value_double
sb_memalign
sb_print_options
io_queue_release
file_mmap_done
munmap
pread
io_queue_init
pthread_mutex_lock
pthread_mutex_unlock
sb_report_cumulative
